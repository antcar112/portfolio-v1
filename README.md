# Anthony Caron - Portfolio Website
This is a portfolio website developed for myself. It was developed using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## :cloud: Hosting
The site is hosted publicly at https://www.anthonycaron.com/.

## :open_file_folder: Local Installation
This site is built with GatsbyJS, so you'll need to have the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/) installed on your machine to run it locally. 

1. Install the Gatsby CLI

    ```sh
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server (found at http://localhost:8000/ by default).
    ```sh
    # run this site locally
    gatsby develop
    ```
